Okay, continuing with the PRD for SynergyMart.

**4. UI/UX Design Direction**

- **4.1 Design Philosophy:**
  SynergyMart's design philosophy is centered around **"Efficient Discovery."** We aim for an interface that is:

  - **Clean & Modern:** Utilizing ample whitespace, clear typography, and a contemporary aesthetic inspired by Shop.app (Ref 10, 11).
  - **Intuitive & Efficient:** Enabling users, especially Priya (primary persona), to find and purchase essentials quickly, drawing inspiration from the streamlined flows of Foodpanda/Pandamart (Ref 2, 4, 7, 9).
  - **Visually Engaging:** Presenting products attractively to encourage browsing and discovery for users like Rahul (secondary persona), incorporating elements of visual storytelling where appropriate.
  - **Trustworthy & Clear:** Providing transparent pricing, clear calls-to-action, and consistent visual language to build user confidence.
  - **Accessible & Responsive:** Adhering to WCAG AA standards and ensuring a seamless experience across devices, prioritizing mobile-first design.

- **4.2 Blending Reference Designs:**
  We will synthesize the strengths of both reference applications:

  - **From Foodpanda/Pandamart (Refs 1-9, 12-16):**

    - **Efficiency:** Adopt the clear, task-oriented structure, especially in the cart and checkout process (Refs 4, 7, 9). Use prominent, unambiguous CTAs.
    - **Information Density (Balanced):** Employ grid layouts for browsing categories and products (Ref 3, 5, 8), similar to Pandamart, but ensure adequate spacing to avoid clutter.
    - **Action-Oriented Elements:** Incorporate direct "Add to Cart" (+) buttons on product cards in grids (Ref 3, 5, 15).
    - **Accent Color:** Utilize a vibrant accent color (similar to Foodpanda's pink/magenta) for key CTAs (Add to Cart, Checkout, Place Order) to draw attention, but use it judiciously against a cleaner base palette.
    - **Cart Accessibility:** Consider a persistent cart icon and potentially a slide-out/modal cart view (Ref 4, 7) for quick review without full page navigation for MVP.
    - **Checkout Stepper:** Implement a clear progress indicator for the multi-step checkout (Ref 7, 9).

  - **From Shop.app (Refs 10, 11):**
    - **Clean Aesthetics & Whitespace:** Adopt the generous use of whitespace, clean typography, and overall minimalist feel to enhance readability and product focus.
    - **Visual Hierarchy:** Structure pages with clear headings and sections, using card components (like Shadcn UI) for distinct content blocks (products, categories, reviews).
    - **Brand Emphasis (Phase 2/3):** While MVP focuses on products, borrow the idea of dedicated brand sections/pages for future phases to cater to discovery (Ref 10).
    - **Product Imagery:** Prioritize high-quality, clean product images, potentially with consistent backgrounds where feasible.
    - **Subtle Interactions:** Incorporate subtle hover effects and transitions for a polished feel, without sacrificing performance.
    - **Detailed Product View:** Structure the PDP (Ref 11) to present information clearly, separating description, reviews (Phase 2), and related items effectively.

- **4.3 Key UI Elements & Styling (Leveraging Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS):**

  - **Color Palette:**
    - **Primary:** White (`#FFFFFF`) / Light Gray (e.g., Tailwind `gray-50`, `gray-100`) for backgrounds.
    - **Secondary:** Dark Gray / Black (e.g., Tailwind `gray-800`, `gray-900`) for text.
    - **Accent:** Vibrant Pink/Magenta (similar to Foodpanda, e.g., `#E7008A` or a Tailwind custom color) for primary CTAs, highlights, potentially sale badges.
    - **Supporting:** Lighter Grays (e.g., Tailwind `gray-200`, `gray-400`) for borders, dividers, disabled states. Green for success messages, Red for errors.
  - **Typography:**
    - **Font:** Choose a clean, readable sans-serif font available via Google Fonts or system fonts (e.g., Inter, Manrope, system-ui). Define consistent font sizes and weights using Tailwind classes (`text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, `font-medium`, `font-semibold`).
    - **Hierarchy:** Use size, weight, and color to establish clear visual hierarchy for headings, body text, labels, prices, etc.
  - **Components (Shadcn UI):**
    - **Buttons (`<Button>`):** Primary buttons use the Accent color. Secondary/outline buttons for less critical actions. Small "+" icon buttons for quick add-to-cart on grids. Destructive variants for 'Remove'.
    - **Cards (`<Card>`):** Use for product display in grids, category links, checkout summary sections. Clean borders, subtle shadows on hover (optional).
    - **Input Fields (`<Input>`):** Standard form inputs for search, login, checkout forms. Clear labels (`<Label>`) and potential helper text.
    - **Dialog/Modal (`<Dialog>`):** Potential use for quick view cart, address entry/selection, or confirmation messages.
    - **Navigation Menu (`<NavigationMenu>`):** Potentially for header categories on desktop, or within a sidebar on mobile.
    - **Accordion (`<Accordion>`):** Useful for FAQs (Phase 2) or collapsible sections in checkout/PDP.
    - **Tabs (`<Tabs>`):** For PDP sections like "Description", "Reviews" (Phase 2), "Related Items" (Phase 2).
    - **Badge (`<Badge>`):** For tags like "Sale", "New", "Save Tk X".
    - **Avatar (`<Avatar>`):** For user profile icon in header/menu.
    - **Checkbox (`<Checkbox>`), Radio Group (`<RadioGroup>`):** For forms, delivery options ("Leave at door"), T&C agreement.
    - **Sheet (`<Sheet>`):** Excellent candidate for the slide-out Cart view on mobile/desktop.
  - **Layout:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes extensively for grid (`grid`, `grid-cols-*`), flexbox (`flex`, `items-center`, `justify-between`), spacing (`p-*`, `m-*`, `space-x-*`, `space-y-*`), and responsiveness (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes).

- **4.4 Wireframe/Mockup Concepts (Textual Descriptions):**

  - **Homepage:**
    - **Header:** Logo left, centered Search bar (`<Input>`), User Avatar (`<Avatar>`) & Cart Icon (`<Button>` variant="ghost" with item count badge) right.
    - **Body:** Horizontal scrollable Category list (`<Card>` or simple divs with icons/text) below header. Main area features a mix:
      - Promo Banner (`<Card>` with image).
      - Product Carousels (e.g., "Hot Deals", "Popular") using horizontally scrolling `<Card>` components with product image, name, price, "+" `<Button>`. Inspired by Ref 10/15.
      - Maybe a grid section for "Shop by Department" similar to Ref 8 but styled cleaner like Ref 10 category blocks.
    - **Footer:** Standard links (Ref 2/10).
  - **Product Listing Page (PLP) / Category Page:**
    - **Header:** Same as Homepage. Breadcrumb navigation below header.
    - **Body:** Responsive grid (`grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4`) of Product Cards (`<Card>`). Each card contains Image, Name (truncated), Price (with discount shown), "+" Add button (`<Button size="sm">`).
    - **Filtering/Sorting (Phase 2):** Sidebar on desktop, potentially a `<Sheet>` or `<Dialog>` trigger button on mobile, containing filter options (Checkboxes, Radio Groups, Sliders). Sorting dropdown menu.
  - **Product Detail Page (PDP):**
    - **Layout:** Two-column layout on wider screens, stacked on mobile.
    - **Left Column:** Product Image(s) - potentially a primary image with thumbnails below, or a carousel.
    - **Right Column:** Product Name (h1), Price (prominent, showing savings `<Badge>`), Short Description/Overview, Quantity Selector (`<Input>` with +/- `<Button>`), Add to Cart `<Button>` (Accent color, full width). Wishlist icon `<Button>` (Phase 2).
    - **Below Fold:** Tabs (`<Tabs>`) for "Product Info" (detailed description, specs), "Reviews" (Phase 2), "Related Items" (Phase 2).
  - **Cart View (using `<Sheet>`):**
    - Triggered by Cart Icon in header. Slides out from the right.
    - **Header:** "Cart" title, Close button.
    - **Body:** Scrollable list of cart items. Each item shows Image, Name, Price, Quantity Selector, Remove button (`<Button>` variant="destructive" or icon).
    - **Footer:** Subtotal, Delivery Fee, Platform Fee, Discount (if applied - Phase 2), Total. "Review payment and address" / "Checkout" `<Button>` (Accent color, full width). Free delivery progress bar/message (Ref 4).
  - **Checkout Flow:**
    - **Overall:** Multi-page flow (using Next.js routing) or potentially a single page with collapsible sections (`<Accordion>`). Clear stepper/progress bar at the top (Ref 7, 9 - "1. Address", "2. Delivery/Payment", "3. Review"). Back button for navigation.
    - **Address Step:** Displays selected address (`<Card>`). Option to change/edit (opens `<Dialog>` or separate page for MVP). "Delivery Instructions" `<Input>`, "Leave at door" `<Checkbox>`. "Save and Continue" `<Button>`.
    - **Delivery & Payment Step:** Delivery Options (`<RadioGroup>` with time/cost). Payment Method selection (`<RadioGroup>` showing saved methods - Phase 2 - or just the integrated option for MVP). Button to add new payment method (Phase 2 - likely redirects to gateway).
    - **Review Step:** Order Summary (`<Card>` listing items, quantities, prices), Address, Delivery Method, Payment Method displayed clearly. Final cost breakdown (Subtotal, Delivery, Fees, Tip (P3), Total). T&C `<Checkbox>` ("By completing this order..."). "Place Order" `<Button>` (Accent color).

- **4.5 Accessibility & Responsiveness:**
  - **Mobile-First:** Design components and layouts primarily for mobile screens, then adapt for tablet and desktop using Tailwind's responsive prefixes.
  - **WCAG AA Compliance:**
    - Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
    - Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>`).
    - Provide `alt` text for all informative images.
    - Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields).
    - Use ARIA attributes where necessary to enhance screen reader compatibility, especially for custom components built with Shadcn/Tailwind.
    - Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation periodically.

  ```

- **5.2 Frontend Architecture (React + Next.js):**

  - **Framework:** Next.js (latest stable version) for its hybrid rendering (SSR/SSG/ISR), file-based routing, API routes (optional, if backend is separate), image optimization, and overall developer experience.
  - **Language:** TypeScript for static typing, enhancing code quality and reducing runtime errors. Strict mode enabled in `tsconfig.json`.
  - **Routing:** Utilize Next.js file-based routing within the `/pages` directory (or `/app` directory if using the App Router). Dynamic routes for PLP (`/category/[slug]`) and PDP (`/product/[id]`).
  - **Rendering:**
    - **SSR (Server-Side Rendering):** Use `getServerSideProps` for pages requiring fresh, user-specific data on each request (e.g., Cart, Checkout, Account).
    - **SSG (Static Site Generation):** Use `getStaticProps` for pages that can be pre-rendered at build time (e.g., About Us, T&C, Privacy Policy, potentially category pages if content is stable). Use `getStaticPaths` for dynamic SSG pages.
    - **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):** Consider for PLP/PDP pages if product data changes frequently but doesn't require real-time updates, allowing pages to be rebuilt periodically in the background.
    - **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** Standard React rendering within components after initial page load, managed via hooks and Context API.

- **5.3 API Layer (REST):**

  - **Design:** Backend exposes a RESTful API. Endpoints follow standard conventions (e.g., `GET /api/products`, `GET /api/products/{id}`, `POST /api/cart`, `POST /api/orders`).
  - **Contracts:** Define clear API contracts (request/response schemas) using tools like OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation and potential code generation.
  - **Status Codes:** Use standard HTTP status codes correctly (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
  - **Error Handling:** Implement consistent error response formats (e.g., `{ "error": { "code": "AUTH_ERROR", "message": "Invalid credentials" } }`).
  - **Authentication:** Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). Tokens issued upon login/signup and sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected endpoints. Backend service handles token validation. Social logins utilize OAuth 2.0 flows.

- **5.4 State Management (React Context API):**

  - **Global State:** Use React Context API for managing global state accessible across multiple components.
  - **Context Providers:** Create specific contexts for distinct global state concerns:
    - `AuthContext`: Stores user authentication status, user profile data, login/logout functions.
    - `CartContext`: Manages cart items, quantities, subtotal, functions to add/remove/update items. Fetches/persists cart state via API.
    - `UIContext`: (Optional) For managing global UI states like mobile menu open/closed, loading indicators.
  - **Provider Placement:** Wrap the main application layout (`_app.tsx`) with necessary Context providers.
  - **Hooks:** Create custom hooks (e.g., `useAuth()`, `useCart()`) to simplify accessing context values within components. Avoid prop drilling.
  - _Consideration:_ For highly complex state interactions or performance optimization needs in later phases, evaluate Zustand or Jotai as lightweight alternatives, but start with Context API for simplicity.

- **5.5 Styling Implementation (Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS):**

  - **Setup:** Follow Shadcn UI documentation to integrate it into the Next.js project. This involves setting up Tailwind CSS and configuring `tailwind.config.js` and `globals.css`.
  - **Component Usage:** Utilize Shadcn UI components (`<Button>`, `<Card>`, etc.) directly. Customize their appearance primarily using Tailwind utility classes passed via the `className` prop.
  - **Custom Components:** Build custom reusable components following Shadcn's patterns where needed, leveraging Tailwind for styling.
  - **Theming:** Configure themes (light/dark - dark mode is Phase 3) and primary colors within Tailwind/Shadcn configuration files.
  - **CSS:** Keep custom CSS minimal, primarily in `globals.css` for base styles or specific overrides not easily achievable with utilities.

- **5.6 Folder Structure:**
  Adopt a clear, scalable folder structure (example using `/src` directory):

  ```
  /src
  ├── /app                     # Or /pages for Pages Router

**6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

- **6.1 Performance:**
  - **Page Load Time (LCP):** Target < 2.5 seconds for key pages (Homepage, PLP, PDP) on a simulated average mobile connection (Fast 3G). Measured via Lighthouse and RUM.
  - **Interaction to Next Paint (INP):** Target < 200ms for user interactions.
  - **Bundle Size:** Monitor frontend JavaScript bundle sizes. Implement code splitting (handled by Next.js) and lazy loading for non-critical components/scripts. Optimize images (Next.js `<Image>`).
  - **API Response Time:** Target P95 API response time < 500ms for most read operations, < 1s for write operations.
- **6.2 Scalability:**
  - **Frontend:** Next.js applications deployed on serverless platforms (e.g., Vercel, AWS Amplify) scale automatically with traffic.
  - **Backend:** API and database architecture should be designed to handle anticipated user load (Goal 1: 10k MAU) and allow for horizontal scaling. Consider serverless functions, container orchestration (Kubernetes), and managed database services.
  - **Database:** Choose a database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB Atlas) that supports scaling and indexing appropriate for e-commerce queries.
- **6.3 Security:**
  - **Authentication:** Secure handling of credentials (hashing/salting). Implement JWT with appropriate expiration and refresh mechanisms. Secure handling of OAuth tokens.
  - **Authorization:** Enforce proper authorization checks on API endpoints to prevent unauthorized data access/modification.
  - **Data Transmission:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication between client and server.
  - **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs on both frontend and backend to prevent XSS, SQL injection, etc.
  - **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `npm audit`, Snyk).
  - **Payment Security:** Comply with PCI DSS standards. Integrate with payment gateways using secure methods (e.g., tokenization), minimizing direct handling of sensitive card data.
  - **Secrets Management:** Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management services for API keys, database credentials, etc. Do not commit secrets to version control.
- **6.4 Accessibility:**
  - **Standard:** Target WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
  - **Testing:** Regularly test using automated tools (e.g., Axe), manual keyboard navigation, and screen reader software (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).
  - **Implementation:** Follow guidelines outlined in Section 4.5.
- **6.5 Maintainability & Code Quality:**
  - **Code Style:** Enforce consistent code style using Prettier and ESLint (with TypeScript plugins). Integrate into CI pipeline.
  - **TypeScript:** Utilize TypeScript's strict mode and define clear types/interfaces for props, state, and API payloads.
  - **Component Design:** Build small, reusable, well-defined components with clear props and responsibilities (Separation of Concerns).
  - **Documentation:** Add JSDoc comments for complex functions, components, and types. Maintain clear README files. Document API endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI).
  - **Testing:** Implement unit tests (e.g., using Jest, React Testing Library) for critical utility functions, hooks, and components. Consider integration/e2e tests (e.g., using Cypress, Playwright) for key user flows (Phase 2).
- **6.6 Reliability & Availability:**
  - **Uptime:** Target 99.9% uptime for production services.
  - **Error Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive error monitoring and logging on both frontend (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) and backend. Set up alerts for critical errors.
  - **Backup & Recovery:** Implement regular database backups and have a disaster recovery plan in place.

  _(Note: Timeline is indicative and depends on team size, complexity of backend, and unforeseen challenges.)_

- **7.3 Key Dependencies & Assumptions:**
  - **Team Availability:** Assumes dedicated resources (Product, Design, Frontend Devs, Backend Devs, QA) are available as per the timeline.
  - **Backend API Readiness:** Assumes backend API endpoints will be available in parallel or slightly ahead of frontend development needs for each feature. Clear API contracts are crucial.
  - **Third-Party Integrations:** Timely setup and availability of payment gateway (e.g., bKash sandbox/prod), social login providers, and potentially analytics/monitoring services.
  - **Content Availability:** Product data (names, descriptions, prices, images, initial categories) needs to be available for population during development and testing. Static content (T&C, Privacy) needs to be provided.
  - **Decision Making:** Timely decisions from stakeholders on design choices, feature priorities, and scope adjustments.

---

**8. Open Questions & Future Considerations**

- **Admin Panel Scope:** Define the specific requirements and features for the internal Admin Panel needed for MVP (Product Management, Order Management, User Lookup).
- **Specific Payment Gateway:** Confirm the exact payment gateway(s) for MVP (bKash confirmed?) and Phase 2 (Cards, etc.) and their technical integration requirements.
- **Logistics & Delivery:** How will delivery timeframes and costs be determined and fed into the system? Integration with a logistics provider? (Assumed handled by backend/operations).
- **Inventory Management:** How is real-time stock managed? How are out-of-stock scenarios handled during checkout? (Crucial backend dependency).
- **Marketing & SEO:** Strategy for initial user acquisition? Technical SEO requirements (meta tags, sitemaps - Next.js helps).
- **Internationalization (i18n) / Localization (l10n):** Is multi-language or multi-currency support needed in the future? Design architecture to potentially accommodate this later.
- **Mobile App:** Is a native mobile app planned? If so, how does this web app fit into the strategy (PWA potential?).
